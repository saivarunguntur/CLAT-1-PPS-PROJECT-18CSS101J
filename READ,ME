Hodda birthday is coming but i fail to recall about getting him a gift.now hodda is angry on me,i have an idea for a gift .Hooda likes coding,why not ive him a problem to solve .Now he is studying the properties of a sequence s,such that its first element is equal to a(s)=a,and the difference between any two neighbouring elements is equal to c (si-si-1=c).in particular,Hooda wonders if his favourite integer b apperas in this sequence, that is ther exists a positiveinteger i,such that si=b.
